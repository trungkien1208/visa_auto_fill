# Browser Installation Issue - Complete Solution

## Problem Summary

Users were experiencing this error when running the Visa Autofill app on Mac:

```
WARNING:root:Playwright reports browser at /Users/nguyendinhhan/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/chromium-1155/chrome-mac/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium but file doesn't exist
❌ Failed to launch browser: BrowserType.launch: Executable doesn't exist
```

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by:

1. **Incorrect Chromium version numbers**: The hardcoded version numbers (131000, 120000, etc.) don't exist for Mac ARM architecture
2. **Complex download logic**: The custom Chromium download system was trying to guess version numbers instead of using Playwright's built-in installation
3. **Environment variable conflicts**: Hardcoded browser paths were causing conflicts

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Simplified Browser Installation Logic

**Before**: Complex custom Chromium download system with hardcoded version numbers
**After**: Prioritized approach using Playwright's own installation system

```python
def ensure_browsers_available():
    # 1. Try Playwright's built-in browser detection
    # 2. Fall back to system browsers (Chrome, Chromium, Edge)
    # 3. Use Playwright's own installation system
    # 4. Provide clear manual instructions if all else fails
```

### 2. Removed Hardcoded Paths

**Before**: `os.environ["PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH"] = str(Path(__file__).parent / "ms-playwright" / "chromium-131000")`
**After**: Let Playwright handle browser paths automatically

### 3. Improved System Browser Detection

Enhanced detection for:
- Google Chrome
- Chromium  
- Microsoft Edge
- Both system-wide and user-specific installations

### 4. Created User-Friendly Tools

#### `quick_browser_fix.py`
- **Purpose**: Immediate fix for end users
- **Features**:
  - Clears problematic environment variables
  - Checks for system browsers
  - Attempts Playwright browser installation
  - Provides step-by-step manual solutions

#### `user_browser_fix.py`
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive diagnostics
- **Features**:
  - Detailed system analysis
  - Network connectivity tests
  - Browser installation attempts
  - Clear error reporting
